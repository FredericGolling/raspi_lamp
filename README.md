# raspi_lamp


My goal was it to create a lamp, which could be controlled via the Telegram API, which also has Smart Home aspects and be energy conservative.

Materials used:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W (running Raspberry Pi OS Lite)
- a strip of 15 SK6812 individually addressable RGB LEDs
- Micro-USB Cable to power the RPI
- a Micro-SD card
- a few crafting materials for the lamp body


Goals:
- LED lamp that could be used as a bed side lamp or for atmospheric lighting
- reacts to inputs over the Telegram Bot API
- has capacity for expanded functions regarding IoT
- relatively energy efficient usage
